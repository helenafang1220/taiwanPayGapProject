# Gender Pay Gap in Taiwanese Culture and Creative Industry

According to The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Taiwan has received 6th globally and 1st in Asia in 2019. The index showed that Taiwan provides safe healthcare services and plentiful employment opportunities for women. However, in another report that based on the Gender Gap Index (GGI), which measures the gender-based gaps through variables such as economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival and etc. Taiwan was ranked 38 out of 156, which nearly fell out of the first quartile. The difference in raking indicates that Taiwanese women are receiving less than opportunities compared to men.

In this post, I began with analysing the pay gap in Taiwanese creative arts industry, as it gives the impression of average lower income. Iâ€™m curious whether women are earning reasonable opportunities and salaries in the industry. Then, I gathered a selection of cultural industries, in order to provide a broader view on the topic.
